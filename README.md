# Fashion_MNIST_Image_Classification

## Overview

This project aims to classify images of clothing items from the Fashion MNIST dataset using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). The dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of 10 different categories of apparel. This project provides a hands-on experience with image classification tasks, leveraging deep learning techniques.

## About the Dataset

The Fashion MNIST dataset is a collection of apparel images falling into several classes. These classes are numbered from 0 to 9 and have the following meanings:

| Class Number | Class Name     |
|--------------|----------------|
| 0            | T-shirt/top    |
| 1            | Trouser        |
| 2            | Pullover       |
| 3            | Dress          |
| 4            | Coat           |
| 5            | Sandal         |
| 6            | Shirt          |
| 7            | Sneaker        |
| 8            | Bag            |
| 9            | Ankle boot     |

Each image is 28x28 pixels, and the dataset is split into 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to build a simple ANN model to classify the images into their respective categories. We will preprocess the data, construct and train the neural network, and evaluate its performance.

## Toolkit

We will use the TensorFlow implementation of Keras for building and training our model. This project will be executed on **Google Colab**, which provides a convenient and powerful environment for running deep learning experiments.
